		<p class="info"> Dachshunds come in different sizes, colors, and hair type. There are 2 different types of sizes: Miniature and Standard. Miniature Dachshunds' heights
		are usually between 5-6 inches while their weight is only up to 11 pounds. Compared to Standard Dachshunds, their height is between 8-9 inches
		and their weight is 16-32 pounds. Dachshunds can also live up to 12-16 years which is longer than the average dog lifespan (10-13 years).
		There are 3 main different types of hair. Smooth, Longhaired, and Wirehaired. They have about 16 different coat colors but they have
		2 main coat colors which are Reddish-brown or black and tan. </p>
		<p class="info"> Dachshunds are long-bodied which gives the appearence of a "hotdog/sausage" look, possess a deep chest, tiny nubs for legs, 
		tapering muzzle and humongous long ears. </p>

		<h2> <i> Personality </i> </h2>
		<img src="PlayfulDachshund.webp" alt="Description" width="200" height="300" class="photo">

		<p class="info"> Dachshunds are an independent breed that enjoy challenges. They are filled with energy, playful, compatible and affectionate with family,
		overprotective and excellent watch dogs but at times can be territorial, fearless, reckless, resentless especially towards strangers.
			These individual dogs can differ in temperment and behavior.
			They have good animal scent tracking so they love to go hunting/fetching and require a walk per day for good exercise (this can help with obesity).
			This breed can be difficult to train by reason of being stubborn, but they do respond well to treats/rewards. </p>
						
		<p class="info"> Almost each type can act differently from each other. The wire-haired variety tend to be more fiesty, brash, and terrier-like.
			The Longhaired are generally less terrier-like and considered more on the affectionate and docile side. Miniatures are more likely to be
			timid but it's still uncommon. Overall though, this breed and their huge variety are wide accepted generalizations.

		<h2> <i> Health Considerations </i> </h2>
		<img src="IVDDinDogs.webp" alt=" description" width="650" height="400" class="photo"> <!-- I chose this image because it's a good visual representation of all the information
		for this category. Also, the file type was the best because... -->
		<p class="info"> Intervertebral Disk Disease (IVDD) is a condition where the cushioning disk between the vertebrae bursts. Almost all Dachshunds
		are homozygous which is the responsible gene at risk for IVDD. 
		There is a mutation within short-legged dogs that causes the disks to harden ultimately can lead to herniated disks. </p>
		<p class="info"> To avoid putting the risk of catching IVDD try dodging movement that is putting any pressure on the back/spine. For instance: 
		don't let them sit up straight, keep away from running up and down stairs, jumping on or off furtniture,
		and twisting and turning the spinal column. </p>
		
		<h2> <i> Care </i> </h2>

		<p class="info"> Coat hair can be a hassle to deal with some coat types since each type of coat type require a different amount of brushing.
		For smooth coat varity, they only require occasional brushing to remove dead hair. As to the longhair varity, they require once
		or twice per week. Wirehaired varity needs the most coat care, they have a neccessity of weekly coming and stripping to help remove
		dead hair.</p>
